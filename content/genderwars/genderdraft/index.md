## GenderDraft 1.01

### Install Directions:

1. Unzip to your current GenderWars directory. - That's it! ^^ Easy, dont you think ;)


### Bugs:

- Sometimes there will be a colored blue highlight around the carry capacity of a
   modified unit with a weapon. This symbolises it being negative.. No way to fix,
   in the exe, but doesn't cause any problems, and you can remove items to get
   it back to positive it necessary.

- Not really a bug, but the Female Race isn't currently supported.

- Sometimes troopers modified have a female sign while they're not in the squad.

- All of the troopers' names modifed after the first four have the same name.

*If you've found a bug Please tell me so I can fix it in the next updates.

### Updates:

#### 1.01:

- Some of the charactors in the regular selection have weapons attached to them by
  default. Doesn't cause any problems, and the weapons will go away if you put the unit
  in the squad selection and then remove him from the squad once again.
  *FIXED*

- Sometimes weapons/troopers can't be removed from the squad list.
  *FIXED*


#### 1.00:
- Inital Release
- Got it to work! ;)
