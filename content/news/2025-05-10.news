{{highlight |text=IronGRP}} 0.4 has just been released and is avaliable at [GitHub](https://github.com/sjoblomj/irongrp). Some of the features have been mentioned before: It has support for Extended Uncompressed GRPs and WarCraft I GRPs, and it can now correctly differentiate between different GRP types. I have added some boundary checks for width, height, offsets and frame count, and added more unit tests. It can now also generate shell completions, to make the tool more ergonomic to work with.

When converting from GRP to PNGs, {{highlight |text=IronGRP}} will now name the output files "uncompressed_frame_xxx.png" or "war1_frame_xxx.png", respectively. This is to make it easier to identify the type of GRP that was used when converting back to GRP. When converting from PNGs to GRP, if no CompressionType is given (or if CompressionType Auto is given), {{highlight |text=IronGRP}} will create an Uncompressed GRP if any of the input filenames contains "uncompressed", and create a WarCraft I style GRP if any of the input filenames contains "war1".

A fair amount of refactoring has been done, so the code is now a bit better structured, and I've prepared to move a chunk of the code to handle the conversion between PNGs and Palettized images into its own library. This will allow me to use the same code in upcomming tools that I have in mind. The cursor formats of WarCraft I and WarCraft II uses the same principle of Palettized Images, as does the Parallax SPK files of StarCraft. I suspect the tilesets of all these games do too, but I haven't looked into that yet.
