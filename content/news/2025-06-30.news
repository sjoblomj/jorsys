I finally made some finishing touches on {{highlight |text=IronTBL}}, the TBL to TXT converter, so I decided to release it as version 1.0.

{{img |file=irontbl.png |title=IronTBL}}

Not much has changed since the last release (apart from some logging improvements), it mostly has some external integrations: comes with [ImHex](https://imhex.werwolv.net) pattern language definitions and [yazi](https://yazi-rs.github.io/) integration, and it can now generate shell completions.

{{highlight |text=IronTBL}} is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/sjoblomj/irontbl).
