Some format specifications have been published, from the {{highlight |text=Camelot Systems}} site. For now, it is only four DAT files from StarCraft, and the Unit data DAT file from WarCraft II.

The plan is to let the collection of formats grow, hopefully to be of pretty much all modding-relevant files. The specifications are available on the [Format specifications](../formats.html) page.
